> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of technologies, servers, and languages. These are things that don't really
warrant a [full blog](https://roozbeh.io) post.

## About

Orginally started the version of "Today I Learned" as [mediawiki pages](http://wiki.gqdev.com), where at times wrote down things I wanted to remember in the future. 
then it turned  into [snippets](http://snippets.roozbehk.com/) on tumblr for easier access and editing.

shamelessly stole the new idea from Josh Branchaud [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who shamelessly stole it from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
