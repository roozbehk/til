Today I Learned


## About

Orginally started the version of "Today I Learned" as media wiki pages, where at times wrote down things I wanted to remember in the future. 
then it turned  into snippets on http://snippets.roozbehk.com/ tumblr so easier access and editing.

shamelessly stole the better idea from Josh Branchaud [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
