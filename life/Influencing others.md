## Connect a strategy or high-level goals. 

When I'm working with organizations, here's a key criticism I hear about otherwise good managers and leaders who aren't getting promoted. Although, they've done very well at advancing their projects, teams or function. The question comes up, what about the broader goals beyond their level? What about making contributions beyond their job description? Those are the people who really stand out. That's just one example of many.

You don't want to be seen, unintentionally, as narrow-minded in your influence priorities. It's limiting to your impact and your career growth, too. Here's what to do instead. First, learn your organization's strategy and the top priority goals at every level hierarchically above your direct responsibility. Second, be seen in positive ways as thinking and caring about what happens beyond your job title. Third and finally, show how what you propose advances the organization's strategy or important performance goals beyond your own direct tasks.

Such as goals for the larger team, unit, function, or organization as a whole. Look for ways to connect your influence objectives to strategic priorities or high level goals. You'll add persuasive force to your argument and also add strength to your professional standing.
